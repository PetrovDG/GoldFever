My name is Dimitar Petrov. I have PhD in Geology and exploration of mineral resources, but I am a beginner in Android development. This is my first Android and Java programming course and my first “complex” project. The app is a short quiz, made according to the “EU Scholarship - Android Development for Beginners” course requirements with some additional features.
The main characteristics of the app are:
1. 4 Activities – Main, Quiz, Result and Wall of Fame (in progress) activities.
2. The Main activity has ScrollView, LinearLayout, TextView, ImageView, EditText view for user name and one button – Start quiz.
3. The Quiz activity has 7 question and possibility to answer with Radio buttons, Check boxes and EditText view. There are two buttons – Check your answers and Results, as the check button is enabled and result button is disabled by default. When player click on Check button it become disabled, the toast message with correct answers appears (the toast message has a Count down feature), and the Result button becomes enabled. 
4. Result activity shows number of correct answers; image – a prize, according to the score, and text - also according to the score. There are 3 buttons – Return, Send results and Wall of Fame. Return button – return player to the main activity, Send button gives possibility to share the score using e-mail, and Wall of fame button open new activity with a list of players – names and scores. For this activity I plan to use Shared Preferences. 

I will appreciate all comments, advices, impressions and contributions according this project and my programming development. 

Thank you in advance!
